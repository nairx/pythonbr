# Assignment 1: Number Guessing Game (Beginner)
# Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. 
# Ask the user to guess the number. If the guess is too high or too low, 
# give a hint. Keep asking until the user guesses correctly. 
# At the end, display the number of attempts taken.
# Concepts Used:
# input() & print()
# Conditionals (if-elif-else)
# Loops (while)
# Random number generation (random module)
